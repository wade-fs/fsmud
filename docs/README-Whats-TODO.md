When developing a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) library (mudlib), some core functions are usually designed to support game operation, player interaction and world simulation. The following are common functional modules and features of mudlib, which can be adjusted or expanded according to the needs of specific games:

1. Object Management
 - Provides the ability to create, copy, and destroy objects (such as rooms, NPCs, items, etc.).
 - Supports object inheritance and polymorphism, making it easier for developers to define different types of game elements.
 - Implemented a virtual object system to reduce memory usage (e.g. no need to create separate instances for each sword).

2. **Player System**
 - Account management: registration, login, password verification, etc.
 - Character attributes: basic attributes such as health, magic points, strength, agility, etc.
 - Archive function: save the player's progress, items and status.
 - Experience and level system: define upgrade rules and rewards.

3. Command System
 - Parse commands entered by the player (e.g. "look", "get", "attack").
 - Support aliases and custom commands.
 - Provides administrator-specific commands (such as shutting down the server, generating items).

4. Combat System
 - Define combat rules: attack, defense, hit rate, damage calculation.
 - Supports real-time or turn-based combat.
 - Handle the battle logic between players and NPCs or between players.

5. **Rooms and Mapping**
 - Realize the connection between rooms (east, west, south, north, etc. exits).
 - Support dynamic descriptions (e.g. changing room descriptions based on time or events).
 - Provide map generation tools or path finding functions.

6. Item System
 - Define the properties of an item (e.g. weight, value, equipability).
 - Supports picking up, discarding, trading and using items.
 - Implement container functionality (e.g. backpacks, boxes).

7. **Quest System**
 - Provides task creation and tracking functions.
 - Support mission status (not accepted, in progress, completed).
 - Reward mechanism: experience points, money, items, etc.

8. NPC Behavior
 - Define NPC dialogue and interaction logic.
 - Supports simple AI (e.g. patrolling, attacking enemies, responding to players).
 - Implement a shop NPC (to buy and sell items) or a quest NPC.

9. Communication System
 - Support chat channels between players (public, private, team).
 - Provide expressions or action commands (e.g. "smile", "wave").
 - Implement announcement or system message functions.

10. Time and Events
 - Simulate in-game time (e.g. day, night).
 - Support for scheduled events (such as monster refreshes, weather changes).
 - Deal with random events (such as sudden NPC attacks).

11. Permission and Security
 - Differentiate between player and administrator permissions.
 - Prevent cheating (e.g. limit command abuse).
 - Implement basic protection mechanisms (e.g. preventing unauthorized access to files).

12. Environment Simulation
 - Weather system: the impact of rain, snow, sunny days, etc. on the game.
 - Ecosystem: The natural behavior of NPCs or monsters.
 - Physics simulation: e.g. falling objects, spreading fire, etc.

A complete mudlib is usually developed based on a MUD driver (such as LPMud or DikuMUD), and customizes these functions according to the game's background story and design goals. For example, a fantasy-style MUD might emphasize magic and combat systems, while a science fiction-style MUD might focus more on technology and exploration.

If you have a specific MUD type or technical question (such as developing it in a certain programming language), please let me know and I will provide more targeted advice!
